# simple_detector
this is a simple script to make the user have time to pull out the bad usb if they had run this script in advanced
it use the fast typing speed the detection but that brough some flaws as well
the script have some flaws like :
#can not detect the same key typing 
#do not have the ability to stop theattacks using mouse 
#users can type as fast as the typing speed limit since it uses the time interval when different  key was pressed 

by the way i have NOT test it in the real situation ,but based on the theory i think i might words 
the test will be done in about a week

if there is any thing to do to make it better ,please give the comments below
